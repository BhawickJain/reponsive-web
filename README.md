Basic responsive web practices using modern HTML, CSS and Javascript practices will significantly reduce the effort of creating good looking sites. These sites will also enable me to explore typographic and graphic-design choices which is a keen interest of mine.

## TODO
`[ ]` Annotation of a good basic HTML page.  
`[ ]` Create a Text Centering example in a div  
`[ ]` Use JS to detect the size of the div and print it in the middle of the div.
