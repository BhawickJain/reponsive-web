Basic responsive web practices using modern HTML, CSS and Javascript practices will significantly reduce the effort of creating good looking sites. These sites will also enable me to explore typographic and graphic-design choices which is a keen interest of mine.

## TODO
`[x]` Annotation of a good basic HTML page.  
`[x]` Create a Text Centering example in a div  
`[x]` Use JS to detect the size of the div and print it in the middle of the div.  
`[x]` Add a section div class and style it.  
`[ ]` Add a Night Mode button with appropriate JS / CSS behaviour. Best if JS can be avoided.  
`[x]` Use JS to toggle all `size-label` on and off using [[mdn-css-before-attr]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before)
`[-]` Â User `sections` class or tag to try out modern layout techniques such as grid and flex boxes.  
`[-]` Figure out how to select the nth document object with CSS  
`[ ]` Create a Rainbow responsive webpage and use Grids and Flex-Boxes to explore those technologies.  
`[ ]` create a page where the section flow into two columns like a newspaper.  

## `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag

```
<meta http-equiv="X-UA=Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```

You don't need it anymore, unless you are concerned with compatibilities anything before IE11 as explained by this [stackoverflow issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do).
